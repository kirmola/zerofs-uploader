# üîê ZeroFS Upload Script (a.k.a. Crypto Yeeter 9000)

## See the source code at [ZeroFS Uploader Script](https://github.com/kirmola/zerofs-uploader)

This thing locks your files with AES before blasting them into ZeroFS. Single files, bulk uploads, entire directories ‚Äî it devours them all. Encryption's optional now (fancy!), supports wildcards, and can process hundreds of files in one go. Toss on notes, tag a vault, flash a token ‚Äî done.

## What It Does

* **Optional** AES-256-GCM encryption with spicy random nonces
* Uploads files (encrypted or raw) straight to ZeroFS
* **Multi-file batch processing** ‚Äî wildcards, directories, you name it
* Auto-switches to multipart uploads for chonky files
* Drops decryption key files when encrypting (don't lose them, genius)
* Optional note tagging & vault assignment
* Download-free streaming with tasty progress bars
* Recursive directory processing
* Smart error handling with continue-on-failure option
* Can decrypt stuff too (wow!)

## You'll Need

* Python 3.7+
* `requests`
* `tqdm`
* `cryptography`

Install the magic beans:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Basic Usage

### Single File Upload (Encrypted)
```bash
python zerofs.py xxxxzers.mkv --encrypt
```

### Single File Upload (No Encryption)
```bash
python zerofs.py xxxxzers.mkv
```

### Multiple Files at Once
```bash
python zerofs.py file1.txt file2.pdf file3.zip --encrypt
```

### Wildcard Patterns (The Real MVP)
```bash
# All PDFs in current directory
python zerofs.py *.pdf --encrypt

# All text files in data folder
python zerofs.py data/*.txt --encrypt

# Mix and match like a boss
python zerofs.py important.doc *.pdf backup/*.zip --encrypt
```

### Directory Upload
```bash
# All files in a directory
python zerofs.py /path/to/folder/ --encrypt

# Recursive directory processing (goes deep)
python zerofs.py /path/to/folder/ --encrypt --recursive
```

## New Hotness: Batch Processing Options

| Flag                 | What It Does                                    |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `--encrypt`          | Encrypt files before upload (optional now!)    |
| `--recursive` / `-r` | Process directories recursively                 |
| `--continue-on-error`| Keep going even if some files fail             |

### Classic Options (Still Here)

| Flag             | What It Does                                 |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `--token`        | API token to prove you're who you are       |
| `--note`         | File note, gets base64'd and sent           |
| `--vault`        | Vault ID for tagging (default: `euc1`)      |
| `--api`          | Override the upload API endpoint             |
| `--merge`        | Override the multipart merge endpoint        |
| `--createrecord` | Override the metadata creation endpoint      |

## Epic Examples

### The Full Monty
```bash
python zerofs.py ~/Documents/*.pdf ~/Pictures/*.jpg --encrypt --recursive --token XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX --note "Personal backup" --vault usc1 --continue-on-error
```

This beast will:
* Find all PDFs in Documents and JPGs in Pictures
* Encrypt each one with individual AES keys
* Upload them all with progress tracking
* Keep going even if some files fail
* Tag everything with your note and vault

### Directory Nuke (Careful!)
```bash
python zerofs.py /entire/project/folder/ --encrypt --recursive --continue-on-error
```

### The Picky Uploader
```bash
python zerofs.py *.mp4 *.mkv *.avi --encrypt --note "Movie collection"
```

---

## Decryption Mode: Because Sometimes You Want Your Stuff Back

**Note: Decryption still only works with single files (for now)**

```bash
python zerofs.py studymaterial.mkv.0fs --decrypt --keyfile studymaterial.mkv_decryption_key.txt --output studymaterial.mkv
```

Flags:
* `--decrypt`: Obvious
* `--keyfile`: Path to your secret sauce
* `--output`: Where to dump the decrypted file

---

## What Happens During Upload

### With `--encrypt`:
1. Each file gets AES-256-GCM encrypted with unique key
2. Saves as `filename.ext.0fs`
3. Drops a decryption key in `filename.ext_decryption_key.txt`
4. Uploads the encrypted blob
5. Cleans up temporary files
6. Shows you a nice summary

### Without `--encrypt`:
1. Uploads files directly (raw)
2. No encryption keys generated
3. Faster processing
4. Still shows progress and summary

---

## Progress Tracking & Error Handling

The script now shows:
* Overall progress (Processing file X of Y)
* Individual file upload progress
* File sizes and processing status
* Final summary with success/failure counts
* Clear ‚úÖ/‚ùå indicators

Use `--continue-on-error` to keep processing even if some files fail. Perfect for large batch uploads where you don't want one corrupted file to kill the whole operation.

---

## Important Crap

* **CHUNK_SIZE** is locked at 90MB. Don't touch it. We mean it.
* Every encrypted file gets its own AES key. Lose it = bye-bye data.
* Notes get base64'd. No, we won't read them. Probably.
* Wildcards are expanded by your shell, so `*.txt` works everywhere
* Duplicate files are automatically filtered out
* Temp encrypted files are cleaned up automatically
* The script handles thousands of files without breaking a sweat

## Typical Workflows

### The Crypto Hoarder
```bash
# Encrypt and upload entire photo collection
python zerofs.py ~/Pictures/ --encrypt --recursive --note "Family photos backup" --token XXXXXXXXXXXXX --continue-on-error
```

### The Selective Uploader
```bash
# Just the important docs, no encryption
python zerofs.py contract.pdf invoice.xlsx presentation.pptx --note "Q4 documents" --token XXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### The Pattern Master
```bash
# All videos from multiple folders
python zerofs.py ~/Downloads/*.mp4 ~/Videos/*.mkv ~/Desktop/*.avi --encrypt --continue-on-error
```

### Later, On Another Machine
```bash
python zerofs.py contract.pdf.0fs --decrypt --keyfile contract.pdf_decryption_key.txt --output contract_original.pdf
```

## Upload Summary Example

```
==========================================
UPLOAD SUMMARY
==========================================
‚úÖ Successful: 47
‚ùå Failed: 3
üìÅ Total files: 50
```

## Troubleshooting (a.k.a. You Broke It)

* No files found? Check your wildcards and paths
* Some uploads failing? Use `--continue-on-error` to push through
* Missing `--keyfile` or `--output` while decrypting? That's on you
* Upload failed? Check your Wi-Fi, genius
* Script eating too much RAM? That's... actually normal for large batches
* Chunk size weird? Stop messing with the code
